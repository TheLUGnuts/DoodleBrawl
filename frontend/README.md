# Doodle Brawler Frontend

Designed with Vite + React, using Chakra UI as a frontend.

# Running

* `npm install` to install required components

* `npm run dev` to open a hot-reloading dev server

* `npm run build` to build a production-ready view.

# Running locally
Make sure to edit `useLocalhost` in `./src/socket.js` to switch between deploying to server or using the local environment.
Obviously `true` uses the local environment.
